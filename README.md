# Map My World Robot
In this project, the topic of mapping and Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) is applied to a previously created robot to successfully generate 2D and 3D maps of the supplied simulated environment using the RTAB-Map technique. This method is again performed to a newly created environment with the same robot and the resulting maps are compared to each other. Both environments are examined in terms of mapping and graded based on the how much of the simulated environment was mapped in both 2D and 3D and how accurate were these mapped environments. The robotâ€™s new sensor addition for this task is then described along with its new configuration and lastly, further enhancements in methodologies will be examined to increase mapping performance in terms of mapped percentage and accuracy.
